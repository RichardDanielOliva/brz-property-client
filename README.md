ReactJS was used for the development of the project. The following complementary tools were incorporated into ReactJS to implement the proposed use cases:

- Redux: allows centralized management of application statuses.
- Redux Thunk: manages asynchronous requests for application states.
- I18next: allows the internalization of the applications, that is to say, multilanguage support to visualize the web. Two languages were added: Spanish-English.
- Leaflet: library for geographic information (maps)
- Styled-component: Extends the capabilities of style sheets by incorporating javascript code in css
- Google Place API. Provides a database to locate places from various variables such as name, latitude and longitude etc.

To consume the data from the server we use the interface already provided by Javascript: Fetch. This allows us to make and receive HTTP requests.
